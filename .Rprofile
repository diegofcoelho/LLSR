#The methods implemented here were based in the protocol proposed by Merchuk et al.
#(1998) and Murugesan & Perumalsamy (2005) to analyse Aqueous Two-Phases Systems.
#Each function brings in its description the reference for the original article
#which described it. These methods defines nonlinear equations that can be used
#to fit experimental data through regression methods and also allow us calculate
#other important system parameters (such as its critical composition, equivolume
#concentration and phase's composition). The package will include (every other
#update) new functions in order to comprise useful functions in liquid-liquid
